Title: An interface to the Semantic MEDLINE database
Description: A programmatic interface to the Semantic MEDLINE database.
    It provides functions for searching the database for concepts and 
    finding paths between concepts. Path searching can also be tailored 
    to user specifications, such as placing restrictions on concept 
    types and the type of link between concepts. It also provides 
    functions for summarizing and visualizing those paths.
